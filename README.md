Our project is based around a fictional dataset that gave us various details on employees and whether they attrited or not. The challenge was to incorporate machine learning to give as an algorithm, for a company or manager to use, that determines if an employee will leave their position. Unfortunately, this data does not allow the creation of a model that can predict when an employee will leave but rather show you the likelihood of resignation in that current moment based on specific variables. From the dataset, we were given ratings for each employee on the below factors:

* Education
* Environment Satisfaction
* Job Involvement
* Job Satisfaction
* Performance Rating
* Relationship Satisfaction
* Work Life Balance

Education was ranked 1-5, 1 being "Below College" and 5 being "Doctor." Environment Satisfaction was ranked 1-4; "Low" to "Very High." Job Involvement, Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating, Relationship Satisfaction, Work Life Balance all had similar 1-4 rankings, with 1 being "Low" and 4 being "Very High/Outstanding."

Other more straight-forward data points we were given were Age, Gender, Marital Status, Job Title, Travel Time and Years Spent in Position. Most importantly, we were also given each employees Monthly Income and a Yes/No of whether they attrited or not.
