# Final-Project
Data found at https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset. This is a fictional dataset about the attrition rate of employees. The challenge is to use machine learning to predict at this particular moment in time whether a person who is currently employed for the company will leave. This data does not allow the creation of a model that can predict when an employee will leave.
From the initial introduction to the dataset, we see the explanation of a few variables:

Education:
1 'Below College',
2 'College',
3 'Bachelor',
4 'Master',
5 'Doctor'

EnvironmentSatisfaction:
1 'Low',
2 'Medium',
3 'High',
4 'Very High'

JobInvolvement:
1 'Low',
2 'Medium',
3 'High',
4 'Very High'

JobSatisfaction:
1 'Low',
2 'Medium',
3 'High',
4 'Very High'

PerformanceRating:
1 'Low',
2 'Good',
3 'Excellent',
4 'Outstanding'

RelationshipSatisfaction:
1 'Low',
2 'Medium',
3 'High',
4 'Very High'

WorkLifeBalance:
1 'Bad',
2 'Good',
3 'Better',
4 'Best'

Additionally, further research helped us conclude that "DailyRate" and "MonthlyRate" refer to the cost of a particular employee in that time period this includes but is not limited to their salary and benefits. The "HourlyRate" is what you would expect, i.e. the rate an employee is paid per hour. Likewise, the "MonthlyIncome" is how much they actually earned per month.
